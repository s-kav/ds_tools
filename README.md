# Function Overview

The library provides a wide range of functions. To see a full, formatted list of available tools, you can use the function_list method:

```python

from ds_tools import DSTools

tools = DSTools()
tools.function_list()

```

# Examples of usage

Here're some simple examples of how to use this library.

## Using the Metrics Module

Calculate Mean Absolute Error and its gradient. The best backend (GPU/Numba/NumPy) is chosen automatically.

```python

import numpy as np

y_true = np.array()
y_pred = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 2.8, 4.3])

# Calculate only the loss value
mae_loss = tools.metrics.mae(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"MAE Loss: {mae_loss:.4f}")

# Calculate both loss and its gradient
loss, grad = tools.metrics.mae(y_true, y_pred, return_grad=True)
print(f"Gradient: {grad}")
```

## Using the Distance Module

```python
u = np.array()
v = np.array()

euc_dist = tools.distance.euclidean(u, v)
print(f"Euclidean Distance: {euc_dist:.4f}")
```

## Real-time Training Monitoring

```python
# 1. Start monitoring
tools.metrics.start_monitoring()

# 2. Simulate training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    # Dummy loss values
    loss = 1 / (epoch + 1)
    val_loss = 1.2 / (epoch + 1) + np.random.rand() * 0.1
    
    # Update history at the end of each epoch
    tools.metrics.update(epoch, logs={'loss': loss, 'val_loss': val_loss})

# 3. Get history as a DataFrame or plot it
history_df = tools.metrics.get_history_df()
print(history_df)

tools.metrics.plot_history()
```

## Evaluate a classification model.

Tired of writing boilerplate code to see your model's performance? Use `evaluate_classification` for a complete summary.

```python

import numpy as np
from ds_tools import DSTools

# 1. Initialize the toolkit
tools = DSTools()

# 2. Generate some dummy data
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])
y_probs = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.3, 0.9, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7])

# 3. Get a comprehensive evaluation report
# This will print metrics and show plots for ROC and Precision-Recall curves.
results = tools.evaluate_classification(true_labels=y_true, pred_probs=y_probs)

# The results are also returned as a dictionary
print(f"\nROC AUC Score: {results['roc_auc']:.4f}")

```

This will produce:
- A detailed printout of key metrics (Accuracy, ROC AUC, Average Precision, etc.).
- A full classification report.
- A confusion matrix.
- Beautifully plotted ROC and Precision-Recall curves.

## Generating a Synthetic Distribution.

Need to create a dataset with specific statistical properties? - generate_distribution_from_metrics can do that.

```python

from ds_tools import DSTools, DistributionConfig

tools = DSTools()

# Define the desired metrics
metrics_config = DistributionConfig(
    mean=1042,
    median=330,
    std=1500,
    min_val=1,
    max_val=120000,
    skewness=13.2,
    kurtosis=245, # Excess kurtosis
    n=10000
)

# Generate the data
generated_data = tools.generate_distribution_from_metrics(n=10000, metrics=metrics_config)

print(f"Generated Mean: {np.mean(generated_data):.2f}")
print(f"Generated Std: {np.std(generated_data):.2f}")

```

## Correlation Matrix Heatmap

Visualize the relationships in your data with a highly customizable correlation matrix.

```python
# --- Sample Data ---
data = {
    'feature_a': np.random.rand(100) * 100,
    'feature_b': np.random.rand(100) * 50 + 25,
    'feature_c': np.random.rand(100) * -80,
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['feature_d'] = df['feature_a'] * 1.5 + np.random.normal(0, 10, 100)

# --- Generate a Spearman correlation matrix ---
config = CorrelationConfig(build_method='spearman', font_size=12)
tools.corr_matrix(df, config=config)
```

This will display a publication-quality heatmap, masked to show only the lower triangle for clarity, using the Spearman correlation method.

## Detailed Categorical Analysis.

Quickly understand the distribution of your categorical features.

```python
# --- Sample Data ---
data = {
    'city': ['London', 'Paris', 'London', 'New York', 'Paris', 'London'],
    'status': ['Active', 'Inactive', 'Active', 'Active', 'Inactive', 'Active']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# --- Get stats for a column ---
tools.category_stats(df, 'city')

=========================== output
           city
     uniq_names amount_values  percentage
0        London             3       50.00
1         Paris             2       33.33
2      New York             1       16.67

```

## Plot confusion matrix.

Helps to plot confusion matrix in graphical kind, especially for calssification tasks.


```python
np.random.seed(42)
N_SAMPLES = 1500

y_true_multi = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=N_SAMPLES)
correct_preds = np.random.rand(N_SAMPLES) < 0.75
y_pred_multi = np.where(correct_preds, y_true_multi, (y_true_multi + random_errors) % 3)

plot_confusion_matrix(
y_true_multi,
y_pred_multi,
class_labels=['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird'],
title='Multi-Class Classification (Animals)',
cmap='YlGnBu'
)
```
