# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This section outlines which versions of the `dscience_tools` project are currently supported with security updates. We are committed to ensuring the security of our users.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 0.9.x| :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |

**Note:** We strongly recommend always using the latest stable version of the package available on PyPI.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The project team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/s-kav/ds_tools/security/advisories/new)** feature on GitHub. This is the preferred and most secure way to report vulnerabilities.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- The version of the package affected.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any example code or data.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.

### Our Commitment

If you use the private reporting feature, you can expect the following process:
1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** We will conduct an initial assessment of the report to determine its validity and severity. We will aim to communicate this assessment to you within 7 business days.
3.  **Updates:** We will keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix.
4.  **Fix and Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will create a new release with the patch. We will then publish a security advisory on GitHub, giving you credit for the discovery if you wish.

We are a small, open-source project, and timelines may vary, but we are committed to addressing all security issues in a timely and responsible manner.
